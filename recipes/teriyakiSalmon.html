        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Teriyaki salmon is a flavorful and succulent 
        dish that features a perfectly cooked salmon 
        fillet glazed with a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. 
        The sauce, typically made from soy sauce, mirin, sake, 
        and sugar, gives the fish a glossy, caramelized finish. 
        The salmon is often pan-seared or grilled, 
        creating a crispy exterior while maintaining a tender
        and moist interior. 
        Garnished with sesame seeds and chopped green onions, 
        it’s usually served with a side of steamed rice and
        perhaps some lightly sautéed vegetables, making for
        a deliciously balanced and satisfying meal.

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, 
                brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, 
                ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. 
                Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. 
                Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade for basting.
                </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag.
                     Add salmon steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, 
                     and seal the bag.
                     Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat
                     source and preheat the oven's broiler. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Broil salmon steaks under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes, 
                    brushing salmon with reserved marinade. 
                    Turn and continue to broil until salmon is opaque and flakes easily, 
                    about 5 more minutes. Brush with marinade.
